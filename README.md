🧠 About the Task

This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Program.
The goal was to analyze social media campaign data and design an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps businesses understand how their campaigns are performing across different platforms and regions.

Objectives

✔ Analyze campaign performance metrics (ROI, CTR, CPA, CPC, etc.)
✔ Identify top-performing platforms and regions
✔ Visualize spend and revenue trends over time
✔ Provide actionable insights for optimizing future campaigns

⚙️ Tools Used

Power BI → For dashboard design and visualization

Excel → For quick data cleaning and preparation

📈 Insights from the Dashboard

✔ Instagram showed the highest ROI (248%), making it the most profitable platform for campaigns.
✔ Europe generated the most conversions, indicating a strong engagement base in that region.
✔ Facebook and LinkedIn maintained steady performance, but with slightly higher spending per conversion.
✔ The months of August and September recorded the highest overall spend and revenue, showing a possible seasonal performance spike.
✔ The overall ROI was 229%, meaning the campaigns more than doubled their returns relative to spend.

💡 Recommendations

✅ Focus more ad budget on Instagram and Europe, where ROI and conversions are strongest.
✅ Investigate North America’s lower performance to identify potential targeting or content issues.
✅ Maintain campaign activity during high-performing months to maximize returns.
✅ Optimize CPC (Cost per Click) through creative testing to further improve efficiency.
✅ Continue monitoring ROI monthly to detect emerging trends and underperforming platforms early.
